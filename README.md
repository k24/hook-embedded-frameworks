# Embedded iOS Frameworks in Titanium
Support embedded frameworks in native Titanium modules and Hyperloop.

### Usage
1. Download the `ti.dynamiclib.js` file and open it
2. Search for the `frameworkPaths` and specify your framework path(s). The paths are relative to the `build/iphone` directory.
3. Adjust your module project code
  1. For classic modules:
    * Add `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS=$(inherited) "@executable_path/Frameworks" $(FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS)` to your module.xcconfig
    * Place the `ti.dynamiclib.js` file in `<your-module-ios-root>/hooks`
  2. For Hyperloop modules (will be automated in future Hyperloop versions - Follow TIMOB-23853):
    * Add the above to the `hyperloop.ios.xcodebuild.flags` object of your appc.js
    * Place the `ti.dynamiclib.js` file in `<your-project-root>/plugins/ti.dynamiclib/hooks`
    * Add the plugin to your tiapp: `<plugin>ti.dynamiclib</plugin>`
4. Some frameworks include Simulator architectures ("fat libraries"). Those frameworks usually provide a script to strip the unused frameworks for distribution, e.g. `strip-framework.sh`. If you use such a framework, adjust the path of the variable `scriptPath`, otherwise `null` it to skip the build script phase.
5. That's it! You can check an example integration in the Ti.Flic module (https://github.com/hansemannn/ti.flic)
